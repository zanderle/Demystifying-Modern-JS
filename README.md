# Demystifying Modern JavaScript using Vue.js

#### DjangoCon Europe 2022 Workshop

## Requirements

To follow along you'll need Node 14.18+ or 16+. You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for easier Node installation.

(Optional): Vue recommends the usage of VSCode + the Volar extension for the best IDE experience, but other major editors are supported as well: https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/tooling.html#ide-support

## Structure

To follow along, clone this repository. Then you can either

```sh
cd start-here
```

to just get the starting files of the workshop. Or you can

```sh
git checkout step-0
```

and then, if you ever get lost during the workshop, you can checkout a certain commit, and continue there.
The workshop will follow the commits and the branches `step-0`, `step-1`, `step-2` and `step-3` to make it easier to catch up even if you got lost at any point.

## Goal

We'll be building a mock app for taking notes during DjangoCon Europe 2022
